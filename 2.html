<h1>Who is this website meant for?</h1>
<p>This website and the text, pictures, and videos on it are meant to inform patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) <a href="">(What is COPD?)</a> about their treatment options. It focuses especially on the choice between managing COPD using medicines and getting a lung transplant.</p>
<h2>What do we mean by severe COPD?</h2>
<p>COPD is never an easy disease to live with. However, some patients' lungs have been more damaged by COPD than other patients' lungs, and so they experience worse symptoms. When patients with severe COPD go to the hospital, it's usually because something happened that was life threatening. Similarly, many patients with severe COPD have limited mobilityâ€”they can't leave the house, or even their room because of their disease.</p>
<h2>Who is this website NOT meant for?</h2>
<p>This website isn't for you if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You are considering lung transplant for treatment of a disease other than COPD (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis)</li>
</ul>
