<p>I got a transplant 2 years ago and it’s been wonderful. The biggest change is that I no longer have to carry an oxygen tank everywhere. I can breathe normally and it feels wonderful. I used to feel suffocated all the time, like I was breathing through a straw. I would panic multiple times during the day because I would get the feeling that I was suffocating. But now, I can get around the house - do the dishes, cook, garden. I can walk take my dog for a walk again. I have my freedom back.</p>

<p>I could not walk from here to the wall there without being out of breath and I was on like four liters of oxygen. I couldn’t dress myself, couldn’t brush my hair, couldn’t barely bathe myself. After the surgery, I woke up with new lungs and (*inhales*) I could breathe. It was overwhelming. Where I came from and where I am now. Now I feel like I’m 16 years old! I babysit my granddaughter. I run errands for my neighbor—she’s a single mother. It’s been a second chance, a new beginning.</p>
<h3 class="icon moreIndependent">Video 3: Mary</h3>
<p>I’ve always been a very independent person. Never wanted any help from anybody. I could do it myself. I cooked at a restaurant and I loved that. But once my COPD got so bad. I needed oxygen all the time. I was breathless just carrying ingredients from the fridge to the counter. I had to leave my job and stay at home most of the time. My husband started taking care of me and taking over a lot of the housework. As things got worse, he had to help me dress myself and take showers.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve had a transplant, I can do a lot of things by myself again. I feel like my own person again. I cook dinner for my family all the time, and aside from that I now cook  a meal for the shelter nearby four days a week. My husband still helps me out and takes me to the doctor, but I can now I have no trouble dressing myself, taking a shower, just taking care of myself, and I can take care of him too!</p>

<p>It’s been two years since I’ve got my transplant, and it has given me my life back. I was always an active person. I was a marine, and then after that I was a firefighter. I was always moving. I taught my grandson how to play hockey and played with him. But when I got COPD, doing anything physical became much harder. I had to move to be closer to my family, so they could take care of me. Just before the transplant, I was stuck at home most of the time. I went to my grandson’s games when I was well enough, but he was still young enough that he’d ask me why I couldn’t play with him anymore. </p>
<p>Getting the transplant let me get moving again. Now, just this weekend I got to play hockey with my grandson. We played for four hours! He scored 3 goals on me, boy he’s getting to be good. I never could have done that without this lung transplant.</p>

<h3 class="icon travel">Video 5: Jeff</h3>
<p>As a kid, I always wanted to travel the world. And throughout my life I did. I went to Thailand and the Philippines when I was younger. I met my wife when I was in Morocco. And my wife and I went on one trip every year. We visited Iceland and Japan and Spain. Every place was an adventure but we were always ready for the next trip. But then my smoking habit from when I was younger caught up with me. I thought I wouldn’t get COPD, but I did. And it got bad enough that we couldn’t travel anymore. It was too much of a hassle to get the oxygen on a plane, and I could hardly walk enough to get around.</p>

<p>I was lucky. Four years ago I got a lung transplant and since then I’ve been able to travel again. We’ve gone to Switzerland, Germany, Ireland, Argentina... I love travel even more now that I’ve had to live without it. I know that things might still go wrong with my transplant—that there’s a chance that these new lungs will wear out and I’ll get sick again. But it has been worth it for these years and the sights I’ve gotten to see.</p>
