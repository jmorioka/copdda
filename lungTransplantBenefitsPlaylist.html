  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon goOffOxygen">Video 1: Bill</h3>
  <p>I got a transplant 6 months ago. Before my transplant, I was so short of breath that I felt as if I was breathing through a straw. My anxiety would often get the best of me because I never knew when I would. But now, I don’t feel short of breath. I no longer have to carry an oxygen tank everywhere. I can get around the house. I can even take care of my own shopping, cooking and cleaning.  Getting my lung transplant has helped me get my freedom back. </p>
  
  <h3 class="icon moreMobile">Video 2: Ken</h3>
  <p>It’s been 5 years since I’ve got my transplant.  It took years before I finally got the call that there were lungs that were a good fit for me. I was one of the lucky ones.  I sailed through the lung transplant surgery and went home within 2 weeks.  The doctors said that it was because I went to pulmonary rehab and was so strong going into the surgery.</p>
  
  <p>The first two years weren’t easy, but they weren’t awful.  I had to learn a lot about how to take care of myself.  I had spent a lot of time getting my labs drawn, my pulmonary function tests measured and visiting with my doctor.  I had to stay overnight in the hospital several times for rejection, but I always made it out in one piece.</p>
  
  <p>The best part of getting a lung transplant was that I was able to travel with my wife again.  We have gone down to Florida every year for the last 3 years now.  I have also gotten to know my grandchildren. I saw my oldest grandson graduate from high school and I held my youngest granddaughter just hours after she was born.  Just think, I might not have met her if I hadn’t had a transplant.</p>
  
  <p>I am starting to slow down now though.  I have something called bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome which is called BOS for short. Although, I have had about 5 really good years, my lungs are starting to break down and I feel short of breath again.  I doubt that I will make it back down to Florida this year.  Even though I feel sick again, I wouldn’t trade the 5 good years that I have had with my family.</p>
