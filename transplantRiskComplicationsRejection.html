<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>Ever since the transplant, I have been taking a lot of medications everyday. The meds make it so that my body doesn’t reject the new lungs. Not too long ago, I began to feel short of breath again. I wasn’t really feeling how I expected to feel after the transplant - I got the sense that my new lungs weren’t working the way they are supposed to. The doctors say my lung function is going down. They call it rejection. I feel like I went through all of this for nothing, all I want is to breathe normally again.</p>
