<h1>Complications</h1>
<p>Complications from the transplant could make you have to stay in the hospital for months or undergo painful medical treatments.
  <ul>
    <li>You might have to have a hole cut in your windpipe to hook you up to a breathing machine.</li>
    <li>You might end up having to have your blood filtered multiple times a week, which takes hours and makes you exhausted afterwards.</li>
    <li>You could even end up having to be on a feeding tube for months, or not be allowed to eat solid food for the rest of your life.</li>
    <li>Your body may not recognize your new lungs and attack them. This can lead to damage to the new lungs, which can make it hard for you to breathe again or even be fatal.</li>
    <li> You may stay in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks after the transplant.</li>
  </ul>
