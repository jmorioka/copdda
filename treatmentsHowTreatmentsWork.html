<p class="breadcrumb">COPD and Treatments for It</p>
<h1>How do COPD treatments work?</h1>
<p>COPD is caused by swollen tubes and damaged air sacs in your lungsâ€”both make it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen.</p>

<p>Treatments for COPD make it easier to breathe by making it easier for air to get into your lungs, giving you air with more oxygen in it, helping your body do more with less oxygen, and surgically removing or replacing the damaged parts of your lungs. COPD can be treated with medicines, exercise, or surgery. </p>
