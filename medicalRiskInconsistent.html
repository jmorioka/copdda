<h1>Medical Treatment of COPD Doesn't Work for Everyone</h1>

<p>Even if you handle your medicines well and exercise, you could get into a bad situation or catch the flu, and that could lead to you spending a long time sick in the hospital, going to the hospital multiple times, or dying.</p>

<p>Complications from COPD can cause repeated hospital visits each year. This can be a burden on both you and your caretaker to continually travel to the hospital and spend a lot of time there getting medicine and treatment.</p>
