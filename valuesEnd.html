        <td>Last Hospital Stay</td>
        <td>5 (Very High)</td>
        <td>Lung Transplant</td>
        <td>Someone with a high pain tolerance would do well during the year after lung transplant, when the treatments and rehabilitation can be long, painful, and difficult. A commitment to improvement and a high pain tolerance, however, will allow you to quickly move past this difficult period of time. </td>

        <td>Pre-COPD Activity Level</td>
        <td>2 (Less Active)</td>
        <td>Medical Treatment</td>
        <td><p>Someone who is less active may do very well with medical management. Even though treating medically can prevent people from some forms of more strenuous exercise, if you are not very active, then this side effect will not be bothersome for you. </p><p>In addition to this, increasing your daily exercise can help you feel better with your daily activities. This wouldnâ€™t be possible if you were already very active and experiencing severe symptoms.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>Support Level</td>
        <td>3 (Somewhat Supportive)</td>
        <td>Medical Treatment</td>
        <td>Since you said your support level was somewhat supportive, that means that medical treatment is probably a better choice for you. The transplant process can be extremely stressful for caregivers, so if you have not as much support, medical treatment is more likely to be a good choice for you.</td>
