      <td>Last Hospital Stay</td>
      <td>5 (Very Good)</td>
      <td>Lung Transplant</td>
      <td>Since you rated your last hospital stay as very good, this implies that lung transplant might be a good choice for you. Lung transplant patients can spend extended periods of time in the hospital, so if you have had good experiences in hospitals, the risk of long hospital stays after transplant shouldn't be as worrying to you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Pre-COPD Activity Level</td>
      <td>2 (Less Active)</td>
      <td>Medical Treatment</td>
      <td>Since you said you were less active before getting COPD, that means that medical treatment might be a good choice for you. One of the disadvantages of medical treatment for some people is that they can't be too active. If you weren't too active to start, though, that's less of a disadvantage for you, and medical treatment might be the best fit for you.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Support Level</td>
      <td>3 (Somewhat Supportive)</td>
      <td>Medical Treatment</td>
      <td>Since you said your support level was somewhat supportive, that means that medical treatment is probably a better choice for you. The transplant process can be extremely stressful for caregivers, so if you have not as much support, medical treatment is more likely to be a good choice for you.</td>
