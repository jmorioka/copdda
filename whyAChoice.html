<h1>Why do you have a choice about your treatment for COPD?</h1>
<p>Many patients with COPD wonder why they have a choice about their treatment for COPD. “Shouldn't I just do what the doctor says?” is a common thought.</p>
<p>The reason that you have been given a choice between <strong>treating COPD medically</strong> and <strong>getting a lung transplant</strong> is that neither treatment option has more of a <em>survival benefit.</em> In other words, on average, patients will live about the same amount of time no matter whether they treat their COPD with medicine or get a transplant.</p>
