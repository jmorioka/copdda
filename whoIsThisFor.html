  <h2>What do we mean by “severe” COPD?</h2>
  <p>Patients with severe COPD have very damaged lungs and experience very bad symptoms. When patients with severe COPD go to the hospital, it’s usually because something happened that was life threatening. Similarly, many patients with severe COPD can’t leave the house, or even their room, because of their disease.</p>
