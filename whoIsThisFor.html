  <h1>Who is this website meant for?</h1>
  <img src="/img/who.jpg"/>
  <p>This website and the text, pictures, and videos on it are meant to inform patients with <strong>severe</strong> Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) about their treatment options. It focuses especially on the choice between treating COPD using medicines and getting a lung transplant.</p>
  <h2>What do we mean by severe COPD?</h2>
  <p>Patients with severe COPD have very damaged lungs and experience very bad symptoms. When patients with severe COPD go to the hospital, it’s usually because something happened that was life threatening. Many patients with severe COPD can’t leave the house or their room because of their disease.</p>
  <h2>Who is this website NOT meant for?</h2>
  <p>This website isn’t for you if:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You are considering lung transplant for treatment of a disease other than COPD (e.g., Cystic Fibrosis)</li>
  </ul>
