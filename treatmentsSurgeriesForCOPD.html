<p>Some surgeries for COPD remove damaged parts of the lung to make the lungs work better. There are two surgeries that are that type: <em>bullectomy</em> and <em>lung volume reduction surgery</em>. </p>
<p>The other kind of surgery to treat COPD is a lung transplant. A lung transplant is when one or both of your lungs are removed and replaced with lungs from a deceased organ donor. Lung transplants can make breathing feel “normal” again and let you go without oxygen again, but they’re risky. You can die in surgery or if your body attacks the new lungs. You can also end up in the hospital for weeks or months at a time from infections from a lung transplant. Even if everything goes right, you still have to do a lot of work after transplant to keep your new lungs healthy.</p>
