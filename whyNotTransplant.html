<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>My dad had good chances of benefiting from a transplant. We had a lot of hope. Soon after his transplant, he became very sick. His body just didn’t accept the new lungs, and the doctors said there was no way to predict this outcome beforehand. He spent about a year in the ICU before he passed away. It was a terrible way to spend the last year of his life - hooked up to machines. In his case, it would have been better for him to stay on his medications and continue exercising. I miss him so much, every day.</p>
