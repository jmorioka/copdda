<p><em>Bronchial tubes</em> are tubes that branch off of your windpipe and let air travel from your windpipe into your lungs.</p>
<p><em>Bronchitis</em> is the name for what happens when those tubes become swollen. This swelling can also be called <em>“inflammation.”</em> That <em>inflammation</em> leads to the build up of mucus in the tube, which blocks them and makes it harder to breathe. People with chronic bronchitis also cough a lot, and cough up mucus. This coughing gets worse in cold and damp weather.</p>
