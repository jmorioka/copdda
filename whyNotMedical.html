<p>The risks of treating COPD medically are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>It doesn't work for everyone.</strong> Even if you handle your medicines well and exercise, you could get into a bad situation or catch the flu, and that could lead to you spending a long time sick in the hospital, <a href="#repeatHospitalVisits">going to the hospital multiple times</a>, or dying.</li>
  <li><strong>There will still be times when you are short of breath.</strong> Though medicine and exercise can help this happen less often, you may still have times when you have a lot of trouble catching your breath.</li>
  <li><strong>You may feel better, but there will be limits to how much better.</strong> You might be able to walk around or walk on stairs again, but you probably won’t ever be able to run.</li>
  <li><strong>You’ll still need oxygen.</strong> Though you might need a little less oxygen with the right medicine and exercise, you’ll still have to use it, carry it around, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="#frequentMedicineUse">You'll <strong>still need to use inhalers</strong> and probably have to take other pills</a> often to help with other problems that COPD creates in your body.</li>
  <li><strong>Your independence will still be limited.</strong> Depending on how sick you are, you may still need to depend on others to shop, cook, clean, drive, etc. for you. You’ll also still need someone who can look after you and take you to the doctor or the hospital when you need to go.</li>
</ul>
