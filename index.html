        <h1>Benefit #3: [Placeholder Text]</h1>
        <p>Many patients with COPD wonder why they have a choice about their treatment for COPD. "Shouldn't the doctor be telling me what to do?" is a common thought.</p>
        <p>The reason that you have been given a choice between <strong>treating COPD medically</strong> and <strong>getting a lung transplant</strong> is that neither treatment option has more of a <em>survival benefit.</em> In other words, most patients will live about the same amount of time no matter whether they treat their COPD with medicine or get a transplant.</p>

        <p class="breadcrumb">Benefits of Medical Management</p>
        <h1>Benefit #1: Going Off Oxygen</h1>
        <p>After going through transplant, you will likely have two or three years where you will not need to rely on an oxygen tank to breathe. This will allow for greater freedom to walk around and do daily tasks. </p>
        <p>Out of 100 patients like you, about 90 of them will be able to go off oxygen for a period of time after transplant. </p>

        <h1>Risk #1: Frequent Medicine Use</h1>
        <p> You will need to use inhalers to get medicine multiple times a day, and often other pills to manage conditions that go along with COPD like high blood pressure and diabetes. This requires you to be very organized and careful to take all your medicine or you will get very sick and potentially require a hospital visit. </p>

        <p>Sometimes patients need a machine to help them get oxygen and give their breathing muscles a break. This machine can require a tube inserted through the mouth, which is done in the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital. If patients reach this stage, they often cannot get off the breathing machine and have to remain permanently in the hospital.</p>

        <h1>Risk #3: Repeated Hospital Visits</h1>
        <p>Complications from COPD can cause repeated hospital visits each year. This can be a burden on both you and your caretaker to continually travel to the hospital and spend a lot of time there getting medicine and treatment. </p>

        <p class="breadcrumb">Risks of Lung Transplant</p>
        <h1>Risk #1: Rejection</h1>
        <p>Rejection occurs when your body doesn't recognize the new lungs and treats them like an invader, attacking them like they would a virus or bacteria. This problem is partially controlled by the drugs you take, but cannot always be avoided. </p>
        <p>Out of 100 patients like you, 30 will experience some form of rejection in the first year after transplant. </p>

        <p class="breadcrumb">Risks of Lung Transplant</p>
        <h1>Risk #2: Kidney Failure</h1>
        <p>Your kidneys help you filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys are under stress for a long period of time, they can stop working as well as they used to work. This can cause fatigue and shortness of breath in the short term and can require a kidney transplant if waste builds up in the system.</p>
        <p>Out of 100 patients like you, 23 will experience kidney failure in the first year after transplant. After 5 years, 55 will experience kidney failure.</p>

        <p class="breadcrumb">Risks of Lung Transplant</p>
        <h1>Risk #3: Extended Hospital Stay</h1>
        <p>Complications after the lung transplant can sometimes require you to stay in the hospital for a length of time immediately after surgery. This can be due to several different problems that the doctors want to monitor. It is likely that with a complication, you would stay 3-5 days in the Intensive Care Unit, followed by a month in the hospital afterwards. You would be required to live within 2 hours distance from the hospital for two to three months after you leave.</p>
        <p>Out of 100 patients like you, 16 will have a one-month hospital stay after surgery. 5 will have a hospital stay of 2 or more months. </p>
