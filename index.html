        <h1>Who is this website meant for?</h1>
        <p>This website and the text, pictures, and videos on it are meant to inform patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) <a href="">(What is COPD?)</a> about their treatment options. It focuses especially on the choice between managing COPD using medicines and getting a lung transplant.</p>

        <p>Medicines for COPD reduce lung inflammation, making it easier to breathe. Exercising helps your lungs work better, like they did before you had COPD.</p>

        <h1>Why do you have a choice about your treatment for COPD?</h1>
        <p>Many patients with COPD wonder why they have a choice about their treatment for COPD. "Shouldn't the doctor be telling me what to do?" is a common thought.</p>
        <p>The reason that you have been given a choice between <strong>treating COPD medically</strong> and <strong>getting a lung transplant</strong> is that neither treatment option has more of a <em>survival benefit.</em> In other words, most patients will live about the same amount of time no matter whether they treat their COPD with medicine or get a transplant.</p>
