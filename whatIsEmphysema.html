<p>At the end of the <em>bronchial tubes</em> in your lungs, there are bunches of tiny air sacs called <em>alveoli</em>. <em>Alveoli</em> inflate and deflate when you inhale and exhale. They are elastic, kind of like tiny balloons. <em>Alveoli</em> are important because they are where oxygen from the air gets into your blood, and where carbon dioxide from your blood gets back out into the air.</p>
<p>When you have emphysema, your <em>alveoli</em> become less elastic. This means that air stays in them when it shouldn't. Since old air gets stuck in the <em>alveoli</em>, new air can't get into the <em>alveoli</em>, and new oxygen can't get into your blood. This makes people with emphysema short of breath, sometimes even when they aren't moving at all.</p>
