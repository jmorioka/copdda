<p class="breadcrumb">COPD and Treatments for It</p>
<h1>How do COPD treatments work?</h1>
<div class="col-1">
  <p>As explained on the <a href="#whatIsCOPD">“What is COPD?”</a> page, COPD is caused by swollen tubes and damaged air sacs in your lungs—both make it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen. </p>

  <p>There are different kinds of treatments for COPD and they work in different ways.
  <h2>Medicine and Lifestyle</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bronchodilators</strong> are a kind of medicine that you usually take through an inhaler. They relax the muscles around your lungs so that it’s easier for air to get in through the tubes in your lungs, even though they’re swollen.</li>
    <li><strong>Steroids</strong> are a kind of medicine that you take through an inhaler. They make the air tubes in your lungs less swollen, so that more air can get through.</li>
    <li><strong>Oxygen therapy</strong> is when you get pure oxygen to breathe through a mask or through tubes in your nose. Normal air isn’t pure oxygen, so your lungs have to work harder to get oxygen out of it. Oxygen therapy helps  because it makes it easier for your lungs to get oxygen into your blood. Having more oxygen also helps you stay healthier, since lack of oxygen makes you feel worse and can hurt other organs in your body.</li>

  <div class="col-1">
    <li><strong>Exercise and breathing exercises</strong> helps you become healthier when you have COPD in a couple of ways. First, exercise helps your body do more with less oxygen, which is good because having COPD means that your body has less oxygen to start with. Exercise also helps strengthen your breathing muscles, so that breathing is easier.Last, exercise strengthens your whole body, so you're less likely to hurt yourself by accident.</li>
    <li><strong>Flu and pneumonia vaccines</strong> help prevent the flu and pneumonia, which can be very bad for people with COPD. (If a person with COPD gets the flu or pneumonia, they can end up in the hospital for a long time, or even die.)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Surgeries</h2>
  <p>Some surgeries for COPD remove damaged parts of the lung to make the lungs work better. There are two surgeries that are that type: <em>bullectomy</em> and <em>lung volume reduction surgery</em>. </p>
  <p>The other kind of surgery to treat COPD is a lung transplant. A lung transplant is when either one or both of your lungs is removed and replaced with lungs from a deceased organ donor. Lung transplants can make breathing feel “normal” again and let you go without oxygen again, but they’re risky. You can die in surgery or if your body attacks the new lungs. You can also end up in the hospital for weeks or months at a time from infections from a lung transplant. Even if everything goes right, you still have to do a lot of work after transplant to keep your new lungs healthy.</p>
