<h1>How do COPD treatments work?</h1>
<p>As explained on the <a href="#whatIsCOPD">“What is COPD?”</a> page, COPD is caused by swollen tubes and damaged air sacs in your lungs—both make it harder to breathe and get enough oxygen.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of treatments for COPD and they work in different ways. Some treatments are medicines, some are lifestyle changes, and some are surgeries.</p>
