<h1>Kidney Damage</h1>
<p>Your kidneys help you filter waste products from the blood. When the kidneys are under stress for a long period of time, they can stop working as well as they used to work. This can cause fatigue and shortness of breath in the short term and can require a kidney transplant if waste builds up in the system.</p>
