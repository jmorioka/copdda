<p>My wife and I used to walk together around the neighborhood every evening. A few years ago I realized that on our walks I was hoping that my wife would run into a friend and talk for a while just so I could catch my breath. I told my doctor about it and he referred me to a specialist. The specialist, Dr. Paul, told me that my lung function was low: 20% of what would be expected for my age. I asked him what I should do and he said I should start walking. I said well, ok. I told him, I don’t really want to exercise because I’m breathless anyway. Sometimes I was breathless just watching TV—I didn’t want to exercise. </p>

<p>But I started. And at first it was difficult, but I gave myself permission to stop and catch my breath as I wanted to. But I did it six days a week, and I did my best, and low and behold my ability to walk increased. I could walk down the street. I wasn’t breathless watching TV. When I put in the effort, I saw that I could walk further and further. It has been so wonderful—I eventually started using a little less medicine. The exacerbations, the flare-ups, that the doctor was talking about were less. And I could walk with my wife again—the whole neighborhood was easy—and when <em>I</em> ran into a friend, I had enough breath to talk to them too.</p>

<p>My doctor prescribed 36 days of pulmonary rehabilitation, where they help you learn about breathing, and exercise, and eating right, and the disease in general. I started going and it was going pretty well, but then I found out that my insurance would only cover 20 days, not 36, and that I’d have to pay for the rest of the days out of pocket. At first I wasn’t going to go, then I told my sister about it and she told me I ought to ask my doctor to talk to the insurance company. I called up my doctor, and she called up the insurance company, and then they worked it out so that what she prescribed would be covered, and after that if I went more I would pay some or all of the cost. </p>

<p>Pulmonary rehab helped me feel a lot better. I learned a lot about my drugs and my disease. Learning pursed-lip breathing helped me start doing basic things around the house more easily. Now, at rehab, I also met other patients. I actually met one guy who had gotten a transplant a while back and he was talking about how much the surgery and all his drugs cost. Once I heard the ballpark he was talking about, I stopped thinking rehab was so expensive.</p>

<p>Yeah, I hadn’t heard much about lung transplants, but I had heard stories of how some patients had gotten transplants and then run marathons, so I figured they were pretty great. The first time I thought otherwise, I was in the waiting room at the doctor’s office. I talking with my brother—he drove me to the doctor— and telling him how I hated how the steroids I was on were affecting me—making me gain all this weight, and making me have to go on high blood pressure medications. </p>

<p>Then this other lady chimed in. She said, you think that’s bad! My drugs have given me hand tremors and hallucinations! Made me think I was going crazy! And one made me nauseous all the time. The doctor’s gave me more pills to take ‘cause of that but then one of the other drugs started doing a number on my kidneys and now I might need to get hooked up to a machine to filter my blood. I asked her what she was on all the drugs for and she said they were to keep her new lungs healthy—she had gotten a lung transplant. After that I realized that transplant might not be a cure—and that transplant drugs can be real bad!</p>

<p>My son, James, he’s just been a saint through all of this. He checks up on me every day in the morning and after he gets off work. He picks up my groceries, and he cooks for me when I’m not feeling up to it. He’s had to take to the ER a few times this past year. I’m so grateful for what he does, and so lucky that he still lives near me—my other kids moved out of state. But I worry about being a burden on him. He has a full time job, a wife, and three kids besides taking care of me.</p>

<p>I had heard some great things about lung transplants, and I thought if I got one I might be able to get back to doing things on my own. I talked about it with my doctor, and he explained that it’s pretty hard on the person taking care of you. They do a ton of work taking care of you and handling everything. He also said it’s—just hard, emotionally.</p>

<p>The doctor said that if I was to get referred for a transplant evaluation, my son would need to take time off work to come with me to the hospital. So that made me reconsider if I really wanted to put my son through all of that. He might be willing to do it, but I don’t want him to quit his job or take time off work, and I certainly don’t want him to put his family on the back burner. </p>
