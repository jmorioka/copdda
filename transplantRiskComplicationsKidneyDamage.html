<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>I received a lung transplant 3 years ago. Things went pretty smoothly until two year ago, the doctor told me that I was showing signs of kidney failure caused by the medication I had been taking after the transplant. At first, I was taking medication for my kidneys on a daily basis to control the condition. But it got really bad and I started to do dialysis. I was hooked up to a machine that filtered my blood 3 times a week. Each time, it took 4 hours and I was always exhausted by the end of it. All I wanted to do was to sleep. It really decreased the quality of life for me.</p>
