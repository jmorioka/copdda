<p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Here is what each word in that name means:
  <ul>
    <li>Chronic: long-lasting</li>
    <li>Obstructive: based on the word obstacleâ€”something that creates blockages</li>
    <li>Pulmonary: related to lungs</li>
    <li>Disease: a medical condition</li>
  </ul>
  Though the name can be confusing, once you know what each word means, it makes sense. COPD is a long-lasting disease that creates blockages in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

<p>As the video above explains, COPD is one word for two diseases. People with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis to some degree.</p>
