  <p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Here is what each word in that name means:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Chronic</strong>: long-lasting</li>
      <li><strong>Obstructive</strong>: based on the word obstacleâ€”something that creates blockages</li>
      <li><strong>Pulmonary</strong>: related to lungs</li>
      <li><strong>Disease</strong>: a medical condition</li>
    </ul>
    Though the name can be confusing, once you know what each word means, it makes sense. COPD is a long-lasting disease that creates blockages in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

  <p>As the video above explains, COPD is one word for two diseases. People with COPD almost always have both <em><a href="#whatIsEmphysema">emphysema</a></em> and <em><a href="#whatIsChronicBronchitis">chronic bronchitis</a></em> to some degree.</p>
