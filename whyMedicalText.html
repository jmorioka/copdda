<h1>Why treat COPD medically?</h1>
<p>The possible benefits of treating COPD with medicines and exercise are:
<ul>
  <li>You have <strong>more control</strong> over the success of your treatment. <a class="preview" href="#">Click here to read why. </a><span class="hidden">For example, if you work hard at pulmonary rehab and exercise regularly, you’ll probably feel better. With transplant, a lot of things are out of your control or the doctors’ control, and things can go wrong even when you have done everything right.</span></li>
  <li>Medical treatment of COPD is usually <strong>less expensive</strong> than getting a lung transplant (though it does depend on your insurance.)</li>
  <li>The <strong>medicines you are taking aren't as bad for the rest of your body</strong> as the medicines you would have to take for transplant.</li>
  <li>Helping you with medical treatment and exercise can be a <strong>more manageable commitment for the people taking care of you</strong> (versus going through the process of getting a transplant.)</li>
