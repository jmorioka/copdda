<h1>Why treat COPD medically?</h1>
<p>The possible benefits of treating COPD with medicines and exercise are:
<ul>
  <li>You have more control over the success of your treatment.</li>
  <li>Medical treatment of COPD is usually less expensive than getting a lung transplant (though it does depend on your insurance.)</li>
  <li>The medicines you are taking aren't as bad for the rest of your body as the medicines you would have to take for transplant.</li>
  <li>Helping you with medical treatment and exercise can be a more manageable commitment for the people taking care of you (versus going through the process of getting a transplant.)</li>
