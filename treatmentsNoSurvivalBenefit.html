<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>I was really surprised when I found out, numbers-wise, I wasn’t likely to live longer with a lung transplant. It turns out that if you’re really sick with COPD, your odds of living five years are about the same whether you get a transplant or keep treating your COPD with medicine.</p>
<p>Now, living with severe COPD, you feel like you’re dying and so it seems like it’s just around the corner. But, with medicine and exercise, and if you don’t get the flu or something, you could easily live 5 years with severe COPD.</p>
<p>Transplant is trickier—there’s a lot of Disadvantages. You’ve got the surgery itself, then Disadvantage of infection or rejection of the organ after. But what really surprised me was learning that lung transplants aren’t like other transplants. After a while, transplanted lungs can just start deteriorating, and the doctors don’t know why and there’s nothing they can do about it. That’s called BOS, and it affects 50% of lung transplant patients by the 5th year after their transplant.</p>
<p>So, even though it seemed like transplant was this cure, it turns out that it doesn’t really up the odds of you living longer. And that’s why the doctors are gave me a choice about the transplant. Since neither option would make me live longer, the choice of treatment had to be based on what I learned about the pros and cons of each option, and what I wanted and what I was willing to put myself through...my values.</p>
