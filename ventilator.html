<p>Sometimes patients need a machine to help them get oxygen and give their breathing muscles a break. This machine can require a tube inserted through the mouth, which is done in the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital. If patients reach this stage, they often cannot get off the breathing machine and have to remain permanently in the hospital.</p>
