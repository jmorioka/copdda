<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>Before the transplant, I was told that there’s a chance that I would be in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks, which is how it normally takes for patients to be released after the transplant. However, I did not believe that it would happen to me. After the transplant, it was hard to get me off the breathing machine because my lungs just wouldn’t work right. And I was on the ICU for a month. I needed a feeding tube to eat as it was impossible to eat by myself. It was months after the transplant when I was finally released from the hospital and went back home.</p>
