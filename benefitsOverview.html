  <p>The possible benefits of treating COPD with medicines and exercise are:
  <ul>
    <li>You have <strong>more control</strong> over the success of your treatment. For example, if you work hard at pulmonary rehab and exercise regularly, you’ll probably feel better. With transplant, a lot of things are out of your control or the doctors’ control, and things can go wrong even when you have done everything right.</li>
    <li>Medical treatment of COPD is usually <strong>less expensive</strong> than getting a lung transplant (though it does depend on your insurance.)</li>
    <li>The <strong>medicines you are taking aren't as bad for the rest of your body</strong> as the medicines you would have to take for transplant.</li>
    <li>Helping you with medical treatment and exercise can be a <strong>more manageable commitment for the people taking care of you</strong> (versus going through the process of getting a transplant.)</li>

  <p>The possible benefits of transplant are:
    <ul>
      <li>You will probably be able to be able to <strong>go without oxygen</strong> (<a href="#goingOffOxygen">Click here to learn more about your chances of going off oxygen.)</a>. You don't have to worry so much about suddenly being short of breath, your tank running out, or feeling like people are looking at you weird for carrying it around. Not having oxygen also makes traveling a lot easier if you want to travel.</li>
      <li>You will probably be able to <strong>get around more</strong>. You could walk your dog or go on a walk with a friend, be able go back to work or volunteering, or even play sports.</li>
      <li>You could <strong>be more independent</strong>. You could be able to drive again, to cook for yourself, and do house or yard work on your own.</li>
      <li>You can spend time with family (and friends) and <strong>be more able to keep up</strong> (especially with grandkids.)</li>
    </ul>
