<p>Y’know, I do manage my COPD pretty well. I haven’t had any flare-ups for a good long while. But one thing that still bugs me is having to tote around a tank of oxygen with me wherever I go. I hate walking into a public place and feeling like everyone’s watching me—looking at me like I’m contagious! When I first went on oxygen, one of my friends was worried that I would get them sick! And besides that, it’s a nuisance. Stairs are hard enough when it’s hard to breathe, but I hate having to lug the tank up the stairs with me. Now I’m looking into getting a portable oxygen concentrator—it takes oxygen out of the air, so you don’t have to refill it, and it’s lighter. But they’re pricey, and I’ll have to talk to my insurance company about covering the cost of that.</p>

<p>I do take a lot of medicines every day. I’m on a nebulizer twice a day, oxygen all the time, one pill four times in a morning and four times at night, and this inhaler once a day. I also have this inhaler for times when I get really short of breath. It’s a hassle to keep track of all of them, and spend time taking them, but it’s what I have to do.</p>

<p>I have had COPD for 11 years. For the past 3, I’ve been house bound. I can’t even go to the grocery store without someone helping me along, pushing me in a wheelchair. So I stopped going very often. My daughter works. She does all my grocery shopping. She calls and gets the list, brings it to me, and puts it away. More recently, I had to hire a lady to help with my housework because I can’t do the big stuff anymore. </p>

<p>I still go to church—my church group takes turns driving me there and back. I get by with help from my family, and my friends, but I can’t get by on my own. I think COPD has helped me learn to be more willing to accept help from others and really made me appreciate them. I’ve had to slow down my life from before, but now I take time to talk to the people in my life and appreciate them.</p>

<p>I was my dad’s caretaker for 7 years, ever since he was diagnosed with COPD. His doctor’sdid their best to treat him, and he did his best to follow their instructions. But he caught pneumonia, and everybody missed it until it was too late. He was sedated and put on a ventilator. I know how scared he was, then. He always said he wasn't afraid to die, that he was afraid to suffer. I still miss him. My dad always felt like he was burdening me by depending on me, but I wish my dad would have depended on me more, he was never a burden. I cherished every second I had with him. Please don't isolate yourself the way my dad wanted to. I wish I could have helped him more and I would have done it for the rest of my life. </p>
