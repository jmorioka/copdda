    <td><strong>It doesn't work for everyone.</strong> Even if you handle your medicines well and exercise, you could get into a bad situation or catch the flu, and that could lead to you spending a long time sick in the hospital, going to the hospital multiple times, or dying.</td>
    <td><strong>You might not be a match for available donor lungs. </strong>Even if you are eligible to get a transplant, you might be unlucky and never get lungs that are a match.</td>

    <td>There will still be times when you are short of breath.</td>
    <td>You have to take <strong>a lot of drugs</strong> (dozens per day), and some of them will make you sick or at risk of being sick in other ways.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>You’ll still need oxygen.</strong> Though you might need a little less oxygen with the right medicine and exercise, you’ll still have to use it and carry it with you.</td>
    <td>The transplant <strong>process is stressful for you and even more stressful for your caregiver</strong>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>You'll <strong>still need to use inhalers</strong> and probably have to take other pills</a> often to help with other problems that COPD creates in your body.</td>
    <td>Complications from the transplant <strong>could make you have to stay in the hospital for months</strong> or undergo painful medical treatments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Your independence will still be limited.</strong> Depending on how sick you are, you may still need to depend on others to shop, cook, clean, drive, etc. for you.</td>
    <td>After the transplant you have to <strong>visit the transplant doctors regularly and get tests</strong> and you may have to live close to the hospital.</td>
