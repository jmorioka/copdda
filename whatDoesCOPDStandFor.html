<p class="breadcrumb">COPD and Treatments for It</p>
<h1>What does “COPD” stand for?</h1>
<p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Here is what each word in that name means:
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chronic</strong>: long-lasting</li>
    <li><strong>Obstructive</strong>: like the word obstacle—something that creates blockages</li>
    <li><strong>Pulmonary</strong>: related to lungs</li>
    <li><strong>Disease</strong>: a medical condition</li>
  </ul>
  Though the name can be confusing, once you know what each word means, it makes sense. COPD is a long-lasting disease that creates blockages in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.

<p>As the video explained, COPD is one word for two diseases. People with COPD almost always have both <em>emphysema</em> and <em>chronic bronchitis</em> to some degree.</p>
