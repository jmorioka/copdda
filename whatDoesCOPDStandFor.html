<p>COPD is a very common lung disease. In the United States, it is the fourth most common cause of death. People can get COPD from years of smoking, from being exposed to chemical fumes or air pollution, or from having many lung infections as a child.</p>
<p>COPD stands for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Here is what each word in that name means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Chronic</strong>: long-lasting</li>
  <li><strong>Obstructive</strong>: like the word obstacle—something that creates blockages</li>
  <li><strong>Pulmonary</strong>: related to lungs</li>
  <li><strong>Disease</strong>: a medical condition</li>
</ul>
<p>Though the name can be confusing, once you know what each word means, it makes sense: COPD is a long-lasting disease that creates blockages in your lungs, making it difficult to breathe.</p>

<p>One important thing to know is that COPD is actually one word for two diseases. People with COPD almost always have both <em>emphysema</em> and <em>chronic bronchitis</em> to some degree, which is why COPD is used to abbreviate both. However, emphysema and chronic bronchitis affect different parts of the lungs.</p>
