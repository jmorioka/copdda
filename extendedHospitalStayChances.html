<h1>Extended Hospital Stay</h1>
<p>Complications after the lung transplant can sometimes require you to stay in the hospital for a length of time immediately after surgery. This can be due to several different problems that the doctors want to monitor. It is likely that with a complication, you would stay 3-5 days in the Intensive Care Unit, followed by a month in the hospital afterwards. You would be required to live within 2 hours distance from the hospital for two to three months after you leave.</p>
