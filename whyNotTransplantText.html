<p class="breadcrumb">Treatment Options’ Risks</p>
<h1>Why NOT get a lung transplant?</h1>
<p>The risks of transplant are:
<ul>
  <li><strong>It doesn't work for everyone.</strong>Even if you are eligible to get a transplant and get one, things may go wrong that the doctors can’t control that could lead to you spending a long time sick in the hospital or dying.</li>
  <li>You <strong>may not get new lungs</strong> even if you are eligible to get them. There aren’t enough donated lungs for everyone who needs them, and not every pair of lungs works for every person, so you might wait a long time for lungs or never get them.</li>
  <li>The transplant <strong>process is stressful for you and even more stressful for your caregiver</strong>. It is a huge commitment for your caregiver in terms of time and work they need to put in. Some caregivers for lung transplant patients say they still have nightmares about it years after the patient gets a transplant.</li>
  <li><strong>Complications from the transplant could make you have to stay in the hospital for months or undergo painful medical treatments.</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>You might have to have a hole cut in your windpipe to hook you up to a breathing machine.</li>
      <li>You might end up having to have your blood filtered multiple times a week, which takes hours and makes you exhausted afterwards.</li>
      <li>You could even end up having to be on a feeding tube for months, or not be allowed to eat solid food for the rest of your life.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You have to take <strong>a lot of drugs</strong> (dozens per day), and some of them will make you sick or at risk of being sick in other ways. You are more likely to get diabetes, infections, cancer, etc. At least some of them you will have to take for the rest of your life. You have to take your drugs according to the doctors’ instructions or you could end up in the hospital.</li>
  <li>After the transplant you have to <strong>visit the transplant doctors regularly</strong> (every few weeks or months for the first few years) and you may have to live close to the hospital. </li>
  <li><strong>Lots of little things change:</strong> you can't get any vaccines, you can't play with your grandkids if they’re sick, you have to avoid crowds and be careful about germs, and there’ll be foods you can’t eat and things can’t do.</li>
  <li><strong>Transplant is expensive.</strong> The surgery and time in the hospital are expensive, and you’ll have to spend time working with the hospital and your insurance company to pay for it. And, after transplant, you still have to pay for doctors’ visits and for expensive drugs.</li>
</ul>
