<h1>Why NOT get a lung transplant?</h1>
<p>The risks of transplant are:
<ul>
  <li>It doesn't work for everyone.</li>
  <li>You may not get new lungs even if you are eligible to get them. </li>
  <li>The transplant process is stressful for you and even more stressful for your caregiver. </li>
  <li>Complications from the transplant could make you have to stay in the hospital for months or undergo painful medical treatments.
    <ul>
      <li>You might have to have a hole cut in your windpipe to hook you up to a breathing machine.</li>
      <li>You might end up having to have your blood filtered multiple times a week, which takes hours and makes you exhausted afterwards.</li>
      <li>You could even end up having to be on a feeding tube for months, or not be allowed to eat solid food for the rest of your life.</li>
      <li>You may end up on a ventilator after the transplant for an extended period of time.</li>
      <li>Your body may not recognize your new lungs and have rejection reactions to them. </li>
      <li> You may stay in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks after the transplant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You have to take a lot of drugs (dozens per day), and some of them will make you sick or at risk of being sick in other ways. </li>
  <li>After the transplant you have to visit the transplant doctors regularly (every few weeks or months for the first few years) and you may have to live close to the hospital. </li>
  <li>Lots of little things change</li>
  <li>Transplant is expensive. </li>
</ul>
The next few pages will tell you more about each risk.
