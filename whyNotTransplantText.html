<h1>Why NOT get a lung transplant?</h1>
<p>The risks of transplant are:
<ul>
  <li>It doesn't work for everyone.</li>
  <li>You may not get new lungs even if you are eligible to get them. </li>
  <li>The transplant process is stressful for you and even more stressful for your caregiver. </li>

  </li>
  <li>You have to take a lot of drugs (dozens per day), and some of them will make you sick or at risk of being sick in other ways. </li>
  <li>After the transplant you have to visit the transplant doctors regularly (every few weeks or months for the first few years) and you may have to live close to the hospital. </li>
  <li>Lots of little things change</li>
  <li>Transplant is expensive. </li>
</ul>
The next few pages will tell you more about each risk.
