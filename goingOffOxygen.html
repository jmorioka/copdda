The biggest change is that I no longer have to carry an oxygen tank everywhere. I can breathe normally and it feels wonderful. I used to feel suffocated all the time, like I was breathing through a straw. I would panic multiple times during the day because I would get the feeling that I was suffocating. But now, I can get around the house - do the dishes, cook, garden. I can walk take my dog for a walk again. I have my freedom back.</span></p>

<p>After going through transplant, you will likely have two or three years where you will not need to rely on an oxygen tank to breathe. This will allow for greater freedom to walk around and do daily tasks.</p>

  <p>Out of 100 patients like you, about 90 of them will be able to go off oxygen for a period of time after transplant. </p>
