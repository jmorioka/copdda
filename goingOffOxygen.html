<p>After going through transplant, you will likely have two or three years where you will not need to rely on an oxygen tank to breathe.</p>
<p>Going off oxygen, you don't have to worry so much about suddenly being short of breath, your tank running out, or feeling like people are looking at you weird for carrying it around. Not having oxygen also makes traveling a lot easier if you want to travel.</p>

  <p>Out of 100 patients like you, about 90 of them will be able to go off oxygen for a period of time after transplant. </p>
  <p>The ten that won’t be able to go off of oxygen won’t be able to because of complications during or after transplant that damage or scar their new lungs.</p>
