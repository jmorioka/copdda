<h2>Video Transcript</h2>
<p>One way to treat COPD is with different medicines. Let’s talk about a few and how they work.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bronchodilators</strong> are a kind of medicine that you usually take through an inhaler. They relax the muscles around your lungs so that it’s easier for air to get in through the tubes in your lungs, even though they’re swollen.</li>
  <li><strong>Steroids</strong> are a kind of medicine that you take through an inhaler. They make the air tubes in your lungs less swollen, so that more air can get through.</li>
  <li><strong>Oxygen therapy</strong> is when you get pure oxygen to breathe through a mask or through tubes in your nose. Normal air isn’t pure oxygen, so your lungs have to work harder to get oxygen out of it. Oxygen therapy helps  because it makes it easier for your lungs to get oxygen into your blood. Having more oxygen also helps you stay healthier, since lack of oxygen makes you feel worse and can hurt other organs in your body.</li>
  <li><strong>Flu and pneumonia vaccines</strong> help prevent the flu and pneumonia, which can be very bad for people with COPD. (If a person with COPD gets the flu or pneumonia, they can end up in the hospital for a long time, or even die.)</li>
</ul>
