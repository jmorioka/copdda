<p><strong>Exercise and breathing exercises</strong> help you become healthier when you have COPD in a couple of ways. First, exercise helps your body do more with less oxygen, which is good because having COPD means that your body has less oxygen to start with. Exercise also helps strengthen your breathing muscles, so that breathing is easier. Last, exercise strengthens your whole body, so you're less likely to hurt yourself by accident.</p>
