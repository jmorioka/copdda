<p>Hello. Welcome to the COPD Decision Aid Website. This website was made for patients with severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It is a tool to help patients with COPD to learn about treatment options for their disease and think about what option is best for them. </p>
<p>Using the website is pretty simple: just use the arrow keys on your keyboard to go between pages. The right arrow key will move you forward through the pages, and the left arrow key will take you back. </p>
<p>You can also turn the page by swiping if you are using a touchscreen (like on an iPad) or by clicking or tapping the links at the bottom of each page. The orange dot at the bottom shows you what page you are on and how pages many are left.</p>
<p>On some pages, there is more to see than will fit vertically on the screen. On those pages, you need to scroll. You can scroll using a scroll wheel if your mouse has one, a trackpad on your laptop, or using the mouse to click on the scrollbar at the right edge of the screen. If you are using a device like an iPad, you can scroll by moving your fingers from the bottom toward the top of the screen.</p>
<p>This website has a lot of videos. Here is how to start and stop them. <em>Presses rounded rectangle with triangle button to play video. Presses button with two tall rectangles next to each other to pause video.</em> Underneath each video, there is a transcript which has everything from the video written out.</p>
