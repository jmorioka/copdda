  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon stressfulProcess">Video 1: Eric</h3>
  <p>Sometimes I think that this transplant process was harder for me than it was for my dad. It was tough from the beginning. We were so happy when he got listed for transplant, but then the waiting started. I felt pretty… powerless would be the word—there was nothing I could do but wait. And sometimes I felt like the worst person in the world, because I knew that for my dad to get lungs, another family would have to lose someone.</p>
  <p>Besides that, it took a lot of time to learn everything about transplant and the process. I took notes on everything the doctors said, and I had to call my dad a couple times every day (when I wasn’t with him) to make sure he was taking his drugs the way the doctors said he should. We had to sell his house and move to an apartment closer to the hospital. That move was hard—he’d lived in that house for 40 years, I grew up there. I don’t even know how many hours I spent on the phone with doctors and coordinators and the insurance company. And even more nights when I couldn’t fall asleep just worrying about it.</p>
  <p>And, don’t get me wrong, I love my dad... but this was hard. Sometimes I had to be the nice guy, supporting him and reassuring him and telling him there was hope. And sometimes I had to be the tough guy, telling him to suck it up and just do what the doctor says. And it was hard taking care of him and worrying about him, all at the same time. I’d say it totally changed our… relationship.</p> <p>After the transplant, it was still hard. I took two months off work, and I took more time off work for the whole first year to take him to the doctors and to the labs. Let’s just say my boss was not happy with me - he didn’t say it, but I could tell he didn’t like how much time off I needed. But what can you do?</p>
  <p>There were times I wanted to quit. I wanted it not to be my job to do all of this. I didn’t ask for it. I often wonder what it’d be like to not need to worry all the time. I don’t know if this is something I could do again.</p>
  <h3 class="icon noLungs">Video 2: Louise</h3>
  <p>I remember how happy we were when Mom was listed. We spent every day hoping that this would be the day we’d get the call, and she’d get new lungs and a new shot at life. I remember the first time we got the call. We were in such a rush to get everything in the car and get to the hospital, but we were all smiling. Then we got there, and waited, and then the doctors told us that the lungs weren’t good enough to be transplanted. They wouldn’t work. It was a heartbreaking moment. After that, we still hoped but we were anxious. We got called into the hospital two more times, but my mom didn’t get the lungs either time. After the second false alarm, I think she stopped hoping so much anymore. We felt like we were cursed with bad luck. And the thing is, she never got new lungs. She was on the list when she died, but she was not one of the lucky ones.</p>

  <h3 class="icon expensive">Video 3: Jennifer</h3>
  <p>I’m truly grateful that I got a transplant, every day I’m thankful for it. Now, beforehand, my husband and I did our research. I knew going in it would be a long road, that this would be a long process and, well, not a walk in the park. And I knew going in that transplants were expensive. But I figured that because I had a good insurance plan it would be okay.</p>
  <p>It turns out transplants are *really* expensive. We talked our insurance company a lot and in the end we had to get a second insurance plan to cover the transplant costs. Now, after transplant, some of the drugs I’m on are really expensive. We’re talking thousands of dollars. We had savings for retirement and, honestly, we dipped pretty deep into those to help pay for this transplant. Now I am better, and I don’t regret a single penny. But the fact is that my husband has had to go back to work to pay for our living expenses, and when I’m well enough I might need to start working part-time too.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 4: Jane</h3>
  <p>I got a transplant a few years back. Overall it went well and I felt that I was pretty prepared. I read most of the stuff the doctors gave me to read. I’ll admit, some of it I read pretty fast—I didn’t want to think about what might happen to me. And so I got a nasty surprise after surgery. I was laying in my hospital bed, and I imagined, and it felt real, I imagined that my sister came into my hospital room and set by bed on fire! It was absolutely terrifying. I was not prepared for that to happen.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 5: Frank</h3>
  <p>After my transplant the doctors had to put me on a ventilator to help me breathe with my new lungs. That’s a breathing machine that looks like this:...[include picture or video of ventilator] To put me on it, they cut a hole in my windpipe—you can see the scar here. And they had to put me under. Being on the ventilator helped me get better, but I have to tell you that it was scary. When they put me under, I worried that something might go wrong and I might not wake up again. Even after they took the tube out of my windpipe, it was painful, like, talking hurt, breathing too hard hurt. But I know I was pretty lucky—I was only on the ventilator for a few days, and some people go on and off of it or have to be on it much longer.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 6: Robert</h3>
  <p>I received a lung transplant 3 years ago. Things went pretty smoothly until two year ago, the doctor told me that I was showing signs of kidney failure caused by the medication I had been taking after the transplant. At first, I was taking medication for my kidneys on a daily basis to control the condition. But it got really bad and I started to do dialysis. I was hooked up to a machine that filtered my blood 3 times a week. Each time, it took 4 hours and I was always exhausted by the end of it. All I wanted to do was to sleep. It really decreased the quality of life for me.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 7: Vivian</h3>
  <p>I had some bad luck after transplant. Getting my new lungs to take took some doing. It wasn’t an easy time. But the part that stuck out to me the most as the worst part was being on a feeding tube. Right after transplant, no one’s allowed to eat. The doctor’s don’t want food to go down the wrong pipe accidentally, or for you to throw up anything into the new lungs if you are nauseous. But I had to be on the feeding tube for weeks and weeks after my transplant. I couldn’t have any solid food. And it was so tempting. I would see commercials on the TV in my hospital room and I made a list of the things I wanted to eat. Besides that it was uncomfortable—having a feeding tube stuck into my belly. I did not enjoy that. But I still feel lucky to have had the transplant, and also lucky because the doctors said that some transplant patients never get back to eating solid food. So for that I thank my lucky stars.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 8: Robert</h3>
  <p>Before the transplant, I was told that there’s a chance that I would be in the hospital for longer than 2 weeks, which is how it normally takes for patients to be released after the transplant. However, I did not believe that it would happen to me. After the transplant, it was hard to get me off the breathing machine because my lungs just wouldn’t work right. And I was on the ICU for a month. I needed a feeding tube to eat as it was impossible to eat by myself. It was months after the transplant when I was finally released from the hospital and went back home.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 9: Kate</h3>
  <p>My dad had good chances of benefiting from a transplant. We had a lot of hope. Soon after his transplant, he became very sick. His body just didn’t accept the new lungs, and the doctors said there was no way to predict this outcome beforehand. In his case, it would have been better for him to stay on his medications and continue exercising. I miss him so much, every day.</p>

  <h3 class="icon intenseFollowup">Video 10: Jack</h3>
  <p>I got a transplant three years ago, and overall it’s been amazing— it has really me a new outlook on life. But I have to tell you, things have only been good because I’ve been working hard, and following the doctor’s instructions. For the first year, I had to live in Pittsburgh, and I was at the hospital all the time. I took the transplant drugs—there are a ton of pills you’ve got to be on after transplant. But the drugs’ side effects made me pretty sick. They made me nauseous and messed with my heart and my blood sugar, so I had to go on even more drugs. Check-ups were no fun—they’ve got to stick a tube down your throat every few months to check and see if your new lungs are still okay.</p>
  <p>Besides that, I’ve just had to be good about managing things after transplant. I’m not allowed to be around anyone who’s sick because the drugs that make my body not attack my new lungs also make it really easy for me to get sick, and really hard for my body to fight off any sickness. That’s also why I’m supposed to be extra careful about germs. I carry around hand sanitizer and wet wipes. I wipe things like restaurant menus down before I touch them.</p>
  <p>So you worry about getting sick, and getting the drugs right. The other part that makes it hard is there’s all kinds of little things that change. I used to love, love, sushi, but now my doctors say I can’t eat it. I know another lady who got a transplant who isn’t allowed to eat potatoes anymore, and I don’t think anyone’s allowed to have grapefruit because it messes with one of the drugs. I have to be careful about sunscreen because I’m more likely to get skin cancer now. </p>
  <p>There’s a lot to keep track of. It’s not like I got a transplant and poof, all better. It really is trading one disease for another. With COPD I had oxygen and I worried about not being able to breathe or getting pneumonia, I went to the hospital when I had flare-ups. Now, after transplant, I still have loads of pills to take, and I worry about getting infections, and I go to the hospital if the doctors think my body’s starting to reject the lungs. I’m still grateful that I got my transplant, and I’d do it again, but believe me, it ain’t easy.</p>
