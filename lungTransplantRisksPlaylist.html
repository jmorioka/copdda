  <h2>Video Transcripts</h2>
  <h3 class="icon stressfulProcess">Video 1: Jack</h3>
  <p>I got a transplanted five years ago, and overall it’s been amazing— I even ran a 5K race last year. Yes, it has been good--but there are a lot of things that I didn’t expect.  I really didn’t expect to be so sick from the transplant medications.  </p>
  
  <p>My hands tremor all the time—worse than it did when I took my COPD medications.  I never know if it is from my tacrolimus (one of my transplant meds) or from my sugars  Yep, transplant did that to me too. I never had high sugars before, but I have it now.  I have to give myself insulin shots and I have to watch what I eat.  </p>
  
  <p>My skin is so sensitive to the sun now—I swear, if I go outside for 15 minutes I get a sunburn.  My doctor says that I have to be really careful because I am at a really high risk of skin cancer because I take the transplant medications.  He even told me to see a skin doctor every 6 months for regular check ups.   </p>
  
  <p>AProbably the worse side effect that I had from the medications is diarrhea.  I had it so badly that I didn’t want to leave the house.  My doctors finally helped me get it under control but it still isn’t normal.</p>
  
  <p>Besides that, I’ve just had to be good about managing things after transplant. I’m not allowed to be around anyone who’s sick because the drugs that make my body not attack my new lungs also make it really easy for me to get sick, and really hard for my body to fight off any sickness. That’s also why I’m supposed to be extra careful about germs. I carry around hand sanitizer and wet wipes. I wipe things like restaurant menus down before I touch them.</p>
  
  <p>There’s a lot to keep track of. It’s not like I got a transplant and poof, all better. It really is trading one disease for another. With COPD I had oxygen and I worried about not being able to breathe or getting pneumonia, I went to the hospital when I had flare-ups. Now, after transplant, I still have loads of pills to take, and I worry about getting infections, and I go to the hospital if the doctors think my body’s starting to reject the lungs. I’m still grateful that I got my transplant, and I’d do it again, but believe me, it ain’t easy.</p>
  

  <h3 class="icon expensive">Video 2: Jennifer—Lung Transplant is expensive</h3>
  <p>I’m truly grateful that I got a transplant, every day I’m thankful for it. Now, beforehand, my husband and I did our research. I knew going in it would be a long road, that this would be a long process and, well, not a walk in the park. And I knew going in that transplants were expensive. But I figured that because I had a good insurance plan it would be okay.</p>
  
  <p>It turns out transplants are *really* expensive. We talked our insurance company a lot and in the end we had to get a second insurance plan to cover the transplant costs. Now, after transplant, some of the drugs I’m on are really expensive. We’re talking thousands of dollars. We had savings for retirement and, honestly, we dipped pretty deep into those to help pay for this transplant. Now I am better, and I don’t regret a single penny. But the fact is that my husband has had to go back to work to pay for our living expenses, and when I’m well enough I might need to start working part-time too.</p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 3: Robert—Dialysis</h3>
  <p>I received a lung transplant 3 years ago. Things went pretty smoothly until about a year ago, when my legs started swelling up and I felt tired.  My doctor told me that the immunosuppression medications that I take are really hard on my kidneys and that I was signs of kidney failure.  The medications that I take are really hard on the kidneys. At first I could get the fluid off with pills, but then I stopped going to the bathroom completely.  I now go to dialysis where they hook me up to a machine that filters my blood.  I go to dialysis three times a week for 4 hours. I am always exhausted by the end of it. All I wanted to do was to sleep. </p>


  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 4: Robert—Long hospital stay</h3>
  <p>When I went to the lung transplant classes, I found out that if everything went well, I would stay in the hospital for only a week or two.  They told me that there was always a chance that I would have to stay longer. I just didn’t think it would happen to me. </p>
  
  <p>After the transplant, it was hard to get me off the breathing machine because my lungs just wouldn’t work right. The doctors told my wife that I had primary graft dysfunction--PGD.  I was on a breathing machine for 2 months after transplantation. They put a trach here in my throat because I need the breathing machine for so long. They also put feeding tube into my belly because I couldn’t eat when I was on the breathing machine.</p>
  
  <p>When I finally got off the breathing machine I was so weak.  I could barely lift my legs. Even the muscles in my throat were weak and I had to learn how to swallow again.  It took me 6 months to finally get out of the hospital.  It has been 9 months since my transplant and I think I am still weaker than I was before I got a transplant.  </p>

  <h3 class="icon complications">Video 5: Kate—Dad never did well </h3>
  <p>My dad never did well after his lung transplant. The doctors couldn’t get him off of the breathing machine.  It seemed as if he always had an infection or rejection.  He never wanted to be kept alive on a machine, but after waiting so long for his lungs we struggled with throwing in the towel.  The doctors said that he had a bad infection in his lungs that was hard to kill off.  The doctors gave him the strongest drugs that they could.   His kidneys stopped working and he had to be started on dialysis.  There are days that he would look better and he would “wean” or took him off of the breathing machine for a bit.  Then the next day he would be sick again and had to be hooked back up to the machine. He was in bed for so long that he started to get bed sores.  They really hurt him.   It was hard to see how anxious he was.  I know that he had nightmares—I mean really bad nightmares.  He finally passed away from a really bad pneumonia.  He told us that he didn’t want to keep fighting.  He had been in the hospital for just under a year. </p>
